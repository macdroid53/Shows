    <!-- the various programs are identified by name, so they can be run
	 automatically when the sequencer starts, and by type, so the
	 sequencer knows which cues to send to which program.  The sequencer
	 sends OSC or MIDI Show Control messages to the specified IP address
	 and port.  The program reads this file to know which port to listen
	 on.  When the main sequencer starts the program, it provides the
	 name of the project file as the only argument.  The program then
	 reads that file to learn everything it needs, including the
	 information in this file.  -->
